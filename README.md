# Description
Univerisiry of Denver - Full Stack Web Developer Boot camp. For week one of bootcamp, a marketing agency has "hired" me to refactor their existing site to make it more accessible. I have updated the website to be more accessible by organizing the HTML elements, added alt attributes, and updated the HTML elements to semantic ones. 

This was an "on-the-job-ticket" to refactor the existing code
